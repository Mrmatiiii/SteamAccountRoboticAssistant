Chrome-Extension for enhancing and automating your Steam-Experience.

This extension is pretty much Alpha-State, so you have to expect bugs and missing features. 
The use of this extension is on your own risk and I'm not responsible for any damage that 
it might cause, but I'm trying my best to avoid such cases.

So lets begin with the more interesting part, the features:
- 2FA-Implementation to confirm market-listings/trades and also generating Login-Tokens
- Database to store your user Accounts/Product-Keys/Games/Cookies and more
- Booster-Profit-Calculator to find the most profitable Booster you can craft
- Reliable Bulk-Sell from your inventory including Multi-Select
- ...

# Installation

You have to download/clone this repo, put the folder somewhere you can easily access it again
and then go into your chrome-settings > Extensions > click "Load unpacked Extension" and add
this extension. When everything went fine you should see a new icon in your chrome-menu.
If you click this Icon a new page opens and ask you to put in your SteamID, API-Key, select
currency and if you want to activate some features. You don't need more at this step.
